## My Personal Page 

**A few facts about me**  

- I was born and raised in Glendale, CA, a city just a few miles from Los Angeles that maintains one of the largest populations of Armenians in the world (my parents immigrated from Armenia just before my birth).  

- If I weren't pursuing a career in science, I'd want to be a production designer for live events (e.g., music, dance, and theater).

- I've swam with whale sharks in Baja California on several occasions - an experience that inspired my love for marine biology.
